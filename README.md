## Why PyLib?

PyLib is a growing collection of reusable Python utilities that fills gaps in
the standard library without introducing unnecessary third-party runtime
dependencies.

- Install only the broad package domain you need.
- Use consistent imports beneath the shared `pylib` namespace.
- Rely on focused, understandable implementations.
- Find complete examples and API details in the hosted documentation.

## Installation

Choose a package from the
[package guides](https://monochromatical.github.io/Pylib/packages/), then replace
`PACKAGE_DIRECTORY` in the Git installation blueprint:

```bash
py -m pip install "git+https://github.com/MonoChromatical/Pylib.git#subdirectory=packages/PACKAGE_DIRECTORY"
```

When a distribution is published to a Python package index, use its documented
distribution name:

```bash
py -m pip install DISTRIBUTION_NAME
```

Package guides provide the exact installation name, repository directory,
import path, examples, and supported API.

## Documentation

The [PyLib documentation](https://monochromatical.github.io/Pylib/) contains:

- Getting-started and installation guidance
- Package-specific tutorials and examples
- Concise generated API references
- Contribution guidelines
- A step-by-step Sphinx documentation guide

Documentation source is maintained in [`docs/`](docs/).
