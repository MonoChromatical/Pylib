Welcome to PyLib
================

A universal, growing collection of reusable Python utilities that fills gaps in
the standard library without introducing third-party runtime dependencies.

PyLib is a monorepo of independently installable packages, so users install only
the domain they need.

.. important::

   PyLib is under active development. APIs may change as the library grows.

Get started
-----------

Choose the domain containing the utility you need from :doc:`packages/index`.
Each package guide provides its exact installation command, imports, and usage
examples.

PyLib packages follow this reusable Git installation blueprint:

.. code-block:: console

   py -m pip install "git+https://github.com/MonoChromatical/Pylib.git#subdirectory=packages/PACKAGE_DIRECTORY"

Replace `PACKAGE_DIRECTORY` with the repository directory shown in the selected
package guide. See :doc:`getting-started` for the complete installation process.

Why PyLib?
----------

* **Standard-library first:** avoid unnecessary runtime dependencies.
* **Reusable:** share focused utilities across many projects.
* **Lightweight:** keep implementations understandable and efficient.
* **Selective:** install only the broad package domain you need.
* **Expandable:** grow into new domains without becoming one large install.
